    "I've recently completed my MSc Business Analytics at Imperial College Business School. My time at Imperial College Business School developed my statistical, operations research and machine learning techniques aimed at solving business problems and obtaining actionable business insight from data. It was a fantastic year of intense growth which let me take my first two experiences as a Data Scientist. The first role was with a FinTech company where I developed machine learning models with scikit-learn to predict start-up Seed and Series A investment rounds. The model was used to advise founders on achievable raise amount based on size, revenue structure, sector and markets. I also developed a pipeline of REST APIs to facilitate the data mining process the team was subject to for each client review. Following that success I secured a position with a Oil & Energy SaaS business where I trained a probabilistic classifier to predict client churn for the company. I provided their risk assessment team with a data-driven churn score based on customer, product usage, industry and business-to-client communication data. The final soft voting ensemble was made up of three classifiers and it helped improve quarterly renewal rates by identifying uncertain clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am now looking for a more permanent position within a team of data scientist where I can learn the best methodologies and techniques to approach problems. Ideally within a large company with room for growth and experimentation! The job search process is always long and because Data Science is a very technical space the interviews, in the later stages of the recruitment process, tend to be technical interviews and tests. Theory about machine learning algorithms, statistics and metrics needs to be studied hard to pass and do well on these tests. I wanted an easy way to test my knowledge of these subjects so I thought a good way to do so would be to send myself questions every day and try to answer them. This way I could identify gaps in my knowledge and see where I am strongest.\n"

      "Boxplot vs Histogram While boxplots and histograms are visualizations used to show the distribution of the data, they communicate information differently. Histograms are bar charts that show the frequency of a numerical variable’s values and are used to approximate the probability distribution of the given variable. It allows you to quickly understand the shape of the distribution, the variation, and potential outliers. Boxplots communicate different aspects of the distribution of data. While you can’t see the shape of the distribution through a box plot, you can gather other information like the quartiles, the range, and outliers. Boxplots are especially useful when you want to compare multiple charts at the same time because they take up less space than histograms. How to read a boxplot\n",
      "Both L1 and L2 regularization are methods used to reduce the overfitting of training data. Least Squares minimizes the sum of the squared residuals, which can result in low bias but high variance. L2 Regularization, also called ridge regression, minimizes the sum of the squared residuals plus lambda times the slope squared . This additional term is called the Ridge Regression Penalty . This increases the bias of the model, making the fit worse on the training data, but also decreases the variance. If you take the ridge regression penalty and replace it with the absolute value of the slope, then you get Lasso regression or L1 regularization. L2 is less robust but has a stable solution and always one solution. L1 is more robust but has an unstable solution and can possibly have multiple solutions. StatQuest has an amazing video on Lasso and Ridge regression here .\n"

It’s much worse to say that someone doesn’t have cancer when they do, instead of saying that someone does and later realizing that they don’t. This is a subjective argument, but false positives can be worse than false negatives from a psychological point of view. For example, a false positive for winning the lottery could be a worse outcome than a false negative because people normally don’t expect to win the lottery anyways.\n"

The tools used to create and run virtually any task automatically. Typically, the system and certain apps use the scheduler to automate maintenance tasks (such as disk defragmentation, disk cleanup, and updates), but anyone user can run it. With this experience, you can start applications, run commands, and execute scripts at a particular day and time, or you can also trigger tasks when a specific event occurs.\n",

A 10am trigger and a 5pm trigger. At both of those times, the python script will execute, a connection will be established with the SQL database, a random question and answer pairing will be returned and an email will be sent containing the pair in the message. The below code is the final python script.\n"

    "This project was a great way to combine various skills Data Scientists need to master with the goal of helping myself out. Storing and querying data on a SQL database is essential because of how useful and power SQL is. Similarly, being able to automate repetitive tasks can save hundreds of hours in the long run and makes a process instantly more efficient and easy to take on. \n",
    "\n",
    "Every question I get emailed I will answer and study to ensure myself I understand the topic being asked and so I feel confident that I can answer the question in real-time when in matters most. Once I know all the questions, I will find a new database and source of questions and repeat the process. I plan to use the Windows Task Scheduler much more in the future with upcoming projects due to its ease and realiability.\n"
