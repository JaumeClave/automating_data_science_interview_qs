# Automating the Boring Stuff: Sending Myself Data Science Interview Questions
<p align="justify">Data science, also known as data-driven decision, is an interdisciplinary field about scientific methods, process and systems to extract knowledge from data in various forms, and take decision based on this knowledge. There are a lot of things that a data scientist should know in terms of programming, theory and communication. The interview process is long and difficult with various interviews and theoretical and practical exams. While I search for a permanent role as a Data Scientist I thought it would be best to spend time each day practicing and learning about what questions may be asked in the interviews so that I am prepared when the time comes. This project scrapes the web for data science interview questions and processes them before importing them into a PostgreSQL database. The database is used to query specific questions based on subjects (machine learning, statistics, programming) and a Python script is created which returns a random question and answer pairing and emails them to my inbox. This task if further automated using Windows Task Scheduler as the script is executed two times a day in order to get good interview practice.</p>
